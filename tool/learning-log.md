## Links I have Used:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://p5play.org/learn/">Main p5play interactive learning textbook</a></li>
<li><a href="https://p5play.org/learn/sprite">Sprite documentation page for creating buttons and handling interaction</a></li>
</ul>

## Things I have tried:
<ul>
<li>Set up canvas using both createCanvas() and new Canvas().<li>

<li>Created shapes like squares and circles on the canvas using rect() and ellipse() in q5.js.</li>

<li>Learned how to position shapes in the middle of the canvas by calculating coordinates.</li>

<li>Tried to implement sprites but realized q5.js doesn’t support sprites like p5.play does.</li>

<li>Managed to keep multiple shapes visible on the canvas by properly using the background function.</li>
</ul>

## Challenges, a-ha moments, etc:
Transitioning sprite-based examples from p5.play to q5.js

Learned the importance of redrawing the background every frame to keep the canvas clean but still draw persistent shapes.

## Questions:
Don't undertand the difference betweem p5.play and q5.js?

Should I fully switch to p5.js and p5.play for easier sprite and game development?

How can I implement the increasing difficulty (more buttons lighting up) feature in this mimic memory game?

How to animate or highlight buttons when clicked in q5.js or p5.play?

## What am I going to try next:
Experiment with creating interactive buttons that respond to clicks and light up.

Adding multiple shapes in color and music in the background if possible

Explore more examples in p5.play to decide if switching to it is better for this project.

### Links I have used today:
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_numbers.asp">JavaScript Numbers</a>
<br>
<a href="https://p5play.org/learn/sprite">p5.play</a>

### Things I have Tried:
<ul>
    <li>Added a start button using HTML</li>
    <li>Made a score Board</li>
    <li>Update the score everytime the user press the button on time</li>
    <li>improved the timing of the game 1s → 0.8s → 0.6s</li>
</ul>

### Challenges / A-ha Moments:
<ul>
    <li>Understanding what ```document.getElementById``` does</liL>
    <li>learning null means "nothing currently selected"</liL>
    <li>Understanding that ```millis()``` is for timing</liL>
    <li>```&&``` checks two things at the same time</liL>
</ul>

### Notes:
<img src="tool/Screenshot 2025-11-16 121953.png" alt="Image of my notes">

### What I'm going to be trying next:
<ul>
    <li>Add a time limit so you don't play the game forever</liL>
    <li>Create a prompt saying "If you would like to restart please refresh the page" after the game ends.</liL>
</ul>

### 12/06/25

### Things I tried:
<ul>
    <li>Adding a 30 second timer so the user can see how many point they can achieve in 30 seconds</li>
    <li>Added an alert so when the user is planning to reset the game, it will tell them to refresh the page</li>
</lu>

```gameStarted``` → the player has clicked start
```!gameOver``` → the game isn’t already finished
```millis() > endTime``` → 30 seconds have passed

### challenges:
<ol>
    <li>The hardest part is making the 30-second timer work correctly while the game is running nonstop.</li>
    <li>Keeping all those parts working together without breaking the rest of the code is what makes it challenging.</li>
</ol>

### What I'm going to be trying next:
<ul>
    <li>Chaning the background color</li>
    <li>Try to attract more users to play my game</li>
    <li>Decoration</li>
</ul>

### Links I used today:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://p5play.org/learn/sprite">p5.play</a></li>
    <li><a href = "https://p5js.org/reference/">p5.js</a></li>
</ul>

### Things I have tried:
<p>Basically playing around with my code to see how the game works. Also made some changes for timing to see if it's going to be easy for the user to play the game. I still hvaen't decorated enough, so I have to do that as soon as possible.</p>

### Challenges:
<p>I'm still wondering how can I attract the user to the game, cause when you go into my game, it looks boring but when you play it, it's not boring due to how challeneging it is. So I wanna make the platform itself look a bit more attracting.</p>

### Things I'm trying next:
<ul>
    <li>Make a good looking background</li>
    <li>Make the user look amazed when they enter my game, like before they start even playing</li>
    <li>MAYBE make more adjusments for the timing because I still think it's a bit challenging for the user to score points, but when I tried it, it was at a decent pace.</li>
</ul>
