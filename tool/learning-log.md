## Links I have Used:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://p5play.org/learn/">Main p5play interactive learning textbook</a></li>
<li><a href="https://p5play.org/learn/sprite">Sprite documentation page for creating buttons and handling interaction</a></li>
</ul>

## Things I have tried:
<ul>
<li>Set up canvas using both createCanvas() and new Canvas().<li>

<li>Created shapes like squares and circles on the canvas using rect() and ellipse() in q5.js.</li>

<li>Learned how to position shapes in the middle of the canvas by calculating coordinates.</li>

<li>Tried to implement sprites but realized q5.js doesn’t support sprites like p5.play does.</li>

<li>Managed to keep multiple shapes visible on the canvas by properly using the background function.</li>
</ul>

## Challenges, a-ha moments, etc:
Transitioning sprite-based examples from p5.play to q5.js

Learned the importance of redrawing the background every frame to keep the canvas clean but still draw persistent shapes.

## Questions:
Don't undertand the difference betweem p5.play and q5.js?

Should I fully switch to p5.js and p5.play for easier sprite and game development?

How can I implement the increasing difficulty (more buttons lighting up) feature in this mimic memory game?

How to animate or highlight buttons when clicked in q5.js or p5.play?

## What am I going to try next:
Experiment with creating interactive buttons that respond to clicks and light up.

Adding multiple shapes in color and music in the background if possible

Explore more examples in p5.play to decide if switching to it is better for this project.
